# Text-Generation
Text generation is a popular problem in Data Science and Machine Learning, and it is a suitable task for Recurrent Neural Nets. This report uses TensorFlow to build an RNN text generator and builds a high-level API in Python3.
For this model I have used a poem in order to train the model using LSTMs and Embeddings.
